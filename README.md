# idworker-snowflake
Snowflake is a service for generating unique IDs at high scale with some simple guarantees. These IDs are unique 64-bit unsigned integers, which are based on time, instead of being sequential. The full ID is composed of a timestamp, a project number, a node number, and a sequence number.
